# affirm-ruby

Ruby client library for integrating with Affirm financing (https://www.affirm.com/)

Requires Ruby 2.1 or greater.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reverbdotcom/affirm-ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reverbdotcom/affirm-ruby)

## Install

Add to your gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'affirm'
```

and `bundle install`.

## Initialize

You should instantiate a Affirm::ChargeGateway object before creating/retrieving a charge. This is useful when your system has multiple Affirm accounts.

```ruby
charge_gateway = Affirm::ChargeGateway.new(
  environment: 'live', # or sandbox
  public_key: 'xxxx',
  secret_key: 'xxxx'
)
```

## Charges

All API requests raise an `Affirm::Error` or subclass thereof on failure.

### Creating/authorizing a charge

```ruby
charge = charge_gateway.create('checkout_token')
```

### Retrieving a charge

```ruby
charge = charge_gateway.retrieve("ABCD-ABCD")

charge.id
charge.amount
charge.created
charge.currency
charge.auth_hold
charge.payable
charge.void?
charge.order_id
charge.events    # array of Affirm::ChargeEvent
charge.details   # hash of order details
```

Raises an `Affirm::ResourceNotFoundError` if the charge doesn't exist.

See https://docs.affirm.com/v2/api/charges/#charge-object for more info on the charge object

### Capturing a charge
Optionally takes an `order_id`, `shipping_carrier`, and `shipping_confirmation`.

```ruby
charge.capture
charge.capture(order_id: "1234", shipping_carrier: "USPS", shipping_confirmation: "ABCD1234")
```

Returns an `Affirm::ChargeEvent` object of type `capture`.

### Voiding a charge

```ruby
charge.void
```

Returns an `Affirm::ChargeEvent` object of type `void`.

### Refunding a charge
Optionally takes an `amount` to refund (in cents).

```ruby
charge.refund
charge.refund(amount: 1000)
```

Returns an `Affirm::ChargeEvent` object of type `refund`.

### Updating tracking fields
Optionally takes an `order_id`, `shipping_carrier`, and `shipping_confirmation`.

```ruby
charge.update(order_id: "1234", shipping_carrier: "USPS", shipping_confirmation: "ABCD1234")
```

Returns an `Affirm::ChargeEvent` object of type `update`.

## Exceptions
Errors due to failed requests with the charges api (ie http code 400) will raise an `Affirm::ChargeError`.

Special exceptions are raised for 5xx, 404 and 401 responses, yielding an `Affirm::ServerError`,
`Affirm::ResourceNotFoundError` and `Affirm::AuthenticationError`, respectively. These are all subclassed from
`Affirm::Error`.

All exceptions have the following methods on them:

```ruby
begin
  charge_gateway.create("checkout_token")
rescue Affirm::Error => e
  Logger.info e.http_code # eg 422
  Logger.info e.code      # eg "auth-declined"
  Logger.info e.message   # eg "Invalid phone number format"
end
```

## Running specs
After bundling, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests.
